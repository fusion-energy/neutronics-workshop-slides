# Why is neutronics useful

- Radioactivity - Neutrons activate material, making it radioactive leading to handling and waste storage requirements.​

- Hazardous - Neutrons are Hazardous to health and shielded will be needed to protect the workforce.​

- Produce fuel - Neutrons will be needed to convert lithium into tritium to fuel the reactor.​

- Electricity - 80% of the energy release by each DT reaction is transferred to the neutron.​

- Structural integrity - Neutrons cause damage to materials such as embrittlement, swelling, change conductivity …​

- Diagnose - Neutrons are an important method of measuring a variety of plasma parameters (e.g. Q value).​
