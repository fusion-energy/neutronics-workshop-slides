# Why is neutronics useful


![bg vertical height:15cm left:10%](images/why_neutronics.png)
- **Radioactivity** - Neutrons activate material, making it radioactive leading to handling and waste storage requirements.‚Äã
- **Hazardous** - Neutrons are Hazardous to health and shielded will be needed to protect the workforce.‚Äã
- ***Produce fuel*** - Neutrons will be needed to convert lithium into tritium to fuel the reactor.‚Äã
- ***Electricity*** - 80% of the energy release by each DT reaction is transferred to the neutron.‚Äã
- ***Structural integrity*** - Neutrons cause damage to materials such as embrittlement, swelling, change conductivity ‚Ä¶‚Äã
- ***Diagnose*** - Neutrons are an important method of measuring a variety of plasma parameters (e.g. Q value).‚Äã

# Task 1, 2, 3
# Microscopic Cross Sections

- Probability of interaction is characterised by the microscopic cross-section (œÉ). It is the effective size of the nucleus.

- Cross section data is key to the neutronics workflow and provide us with the likelihood of a particular interaction.

- Cross sections can be measured experimentally with monoenergetic neutrons.

---
# Experimental data

Availability of experimental data varies for different reactions and different isotopes.

Typically the experimental data is then interpreted to create evaluation libraries, such as ENDF, JEFF, JENDL, CENDL.

# Cross section reactions

Cross section evaluations exist for:

- different nuclides
- different interactions.

A list of reactions available in OpenMC is [here](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/tallies.html#id2)

For example Be9(n,2n)2He would be a neutron interaction with beryllium 9 which results in 2 neutrons and 2 helium nuclei.

# Reaction rate

The reaction rate ($RR$) can be found by knowing the number of neutrons per unit volume ($n$), the velocity of neutrons ($v$), the material density ($p$), Avogadro's number ($N_{a}$), the microscopic cross section at the neutron energy ($\sigma_{e}$) and the atomic weight of the material ($M$). This reduces down to the neutron flux ($\phi$), nuclide number density ($N_{d}$) and microscopic cross section\sigma_{e}. This can be reduced one more stage by making use of the Macroscopic cross section ($\Sigma_{e}$).


$$ RR = \frac{nv\rho N_{a}\sigma_{e} }{M} = \phi N_{d} \sigma_{e} = \phi \Sigma_{e} $$
