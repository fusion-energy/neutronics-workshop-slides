# Fusion Neutronics Workshop

# Why is neutronics useful


- **Radioactivity** - Neutrons activate material, making it radioactive leading to handling and waste storage requirements.​

- **Hazardous** - Neutrons are Hazardous to health and shielded will be needed to protect the workforce.​

- ***Produce fuel*** - Neutrons will be needed to convert lithium into tritium to fuel the reactor.​

- ***Electricity*** - 80% of the energy release by each DT reaction is transferred to the neutron.​

- ***Structural integrity*** - Neutrons cause damage to materials such as embrittlement, swelling, change conductivity …​

- ***Diagnose*** - Neutrons are an important method of measuring a variety of plasma parameters (e.g. Q value).​
